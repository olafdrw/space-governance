We are excited to announce the Space Futures Initiative, which has a mission of conducting research, education, and outreach to improve the long-term future in outer space for humanity and our descendants.\
\
We believe **sharing longtermist ideas within the space community** and developing **scalable space governance frameworks** are currently neglected areas. Conducting these activities requires engagement between the longtermist community, space policy community, space industry, scientific community, and beyond. The Space Futures Initiative aims to engage students and academic researchers, produce valuable long-term space futures research, and collaborate with key stakeholders to discuss and implement plans to improve long-term space futures.\
\
The ongoing proliferation of space activities has outpaced our ability to develop appropriate norms and governance structures for a sustainable future in outer space. Furthermore, transformative technologies in the relatively near future might allow leading space actors to significantly influence humanityâ€™s long-term trajectory. As a result, right now might be an important opportunity to positively impact long-term space governance frameworks and norms.\
\
The Space Futures Initiative is intended to be a collaboration among effective altruists, longtermists, astrophysicists, aerospace engineers, legal scholars, social scientists, philosophers, and others interested in long-term space futures. While our primary focus is conducting research, we also interface with key stakeholders in dialogue on outer space, including the commercial sector and advocacy organizations in policy making hubs.\
\
We are appreciative of our early supporters and excited about further collaboration with organizations including the [Center for Space Governance](https://governance.space/) and [Simon Institute for Longterm Governance](https://www.simoninstitute.ch/). Our directors are Madeleine Chang, Carson Ezell, and Olaf Willner.\
\
Our initial activities include the following:

* Developing an initial [research agenda](https://spacefuturesinitiative.org/research-agenda/) and [research papers](https://spacefuturesinitiative.org/papers/)
* Hosting discussion groups at Harvard and MIT based on an upcoming curriculum for space governance and space futures
* Supporting academic research projects related to **space technologies**, **space governance**, and **space ethics**

We are also excited to collaborate with more organizations and individuals interested in our mission. The following are specific ways in which you may be able to provide support or get involved:



* Send us an academic research proposal related to space futures that you would be interested in pursuing further, or express interest in conducting research with us
* Support space governance and space futures researchers who can contribute to answering questions on our research agenda within other research programs (e.g. [CERI](https://www.camxrisk.org/), [SERI](https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/stanford-existential-risks-initiative/content/stanford-existential-risks-initiative), [CHERI](https://effectivealtruism.ch/swiss-existential-risk-initiative), etc.)
* Let us know that you are willing to mentor an undergraduate or graduate student on a space governance/space futures research project
* Express interest in hosting a space governance discussion group within your university or local EA group, using our upcoming curriculum or other space futures related materials
* Send us ideas for new considerations within space futures that might merit further research, or criticisms of priorities within our current research agenda
* Send an email to [carson@spacefuturesinitiative.org](mailto:carson@spacefuturesinitiative.org) or [olaf@spacefuturesinitiative.org](mailto:olaf@spacefuturesinitiative.org) with any other ideas or feedback

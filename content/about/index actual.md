We are excited to announce the Space Futures Initiative, which has a mission of conducting research, education, and outreach to improve the longterm future in outer space for humanity and its descendants.
</br>
</br>

Improving space governance frameworks and promoting longtermist norms and values for positive space futures are currently highly neglected areas. Addressing these problems requires collaboration between the longtermist community, space policy community, space industry, scientific community, and beyond. The Space Futures Initiative aims to develop students into future-oriented thinkers, contribute valuable research to the space governance and space futures fields, and collaborate with key stakeholders to discuss and implement plans to improve longterm space futures. 
</br>
</br>

Right now might be an important opportunity to positively impact longterm space governance frameworks and the norms and values that guide future spacefaring activities. The recent emergence of widespread space activities means we do not yet have deeply-rooted structures for space governance, so now might be a pivotal moment to shape their development. Furthermore, transformative technologies in the relatively near future might allow leading space actors to significantly influence the norms and values that guide the future of spacefaring. Shaping the discussion around longtermist considerations before these transformative space activities begin could be highly valuable.
</br>
</br>

The Space Futures Initiative is intended to be a collaboration among effective altruists, longtermists, astrophysicists, aerospace engineers, legal scholars, social scientists, philosophers, and others interested in longterm space futures. We are primarily students and researchers, but we interface with other key stakeholders in dialogue on outer space, including the commercial sector and advocacy organizations in policy making hubs. We are appreciative of our early collaborators and supporters at the Simon Institute for Longterm Governance, Center for Space Governance, Cambridge Existential Risk Initiative and Longview Philantropy. Our directors are Madeleine Chang, Carson Ezell, and Olaf Willner. 
</br>
</br>

Our initial activities include the following:
Discussion groups at Harvard/MIT and Cornell based on a new curriculum for space governance and space futures
Supporting research projects and research teams related to space futures.
</br>
</br>

We are also excited to collaborate with more organizations and individuals interested in our mission. The following are specific ways in which you may be able to provide support:
Let us know that you are willing to mentor an undergraduate or graduate student on a space governance/space futures research project (expected time commitment: 1 hr/week)
Express interest in hosting a space governance discussion group within your university or local EA group, using our curriculum or other space futures related materials
Send us ideas for new considerations within space futures that might merit further research, or criticisms of priorities within our current research agenda
Share an academic research proposal related to space governance or space futures that you would be interested in pursuing further.

Send an email to carson@spacefuturesinitiative.org or olaf@spacefuturesinitiative.org with any other ideas or feedback.

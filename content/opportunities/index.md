The Space Futures Initiative is looking to support space governance and space futures research projects by graduate students, undergraduates, or others. Applicants can apply individually, with collaborators, or with a mentor. You can also request to be introduced to potential collaborators, or we can find you a mentor with relevant expertise for your project.\
\
Our stipends are typically $2,500, and we expect a time commitment of 5-10 hours per week over the course of an academic semester (about 14 weeks). We may offer stipends of smaller or larger amounts for projects that differ in duration or time-intensity, especially if we find it impactful for see a more in-depth analysis or a brief exploration of a particular topic. We may also have additional funding available after the project has been completed to support travel to conferences to present your findings.\
\
In addition, we highly encourage established researchers who commonly interact with students to apply for funding to support a studentâ€™s project at their home institution for which they can provide mentorship. We encourage these applications in situations where a mentor is extremely interested in advising a particular project or exploring space governance and space futures.\
\
We are interested in seeing a wide variety of research proposals related to space governance or space futures. This includes an exploration of space governance mechanisms, considering ideal longterm norms and values in outer space, or something else. Our research agenda and foundational research might provide inspiration for projects, but our interests are not constrained to these topics.\
\
We are interested to see projects from students and researchers without prior experience in space governance and space futures, especially those interested in applying expertise from other fields. Here are some examples of research questions we think are worth exploring:



* **History:** How can we apply lessons from past colonization efforts to outer space? 
* **Political Theory:** To what extent should space actors have claims to outer space resources and territory in the near-term and long-term future?
* **International Relations:** How will space exploration in the near-term and long-term future impact great power relations and global power dynamics?
* **Economics:** Should there be a global [dividend](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323247905_Can_space_mining_benefit_all_of_humanity_The_resource_fund_and_citizen%27s_dividend_model_of_Alaska_the_%27last_frontier%27), or another framework for sharing wealth, for outer space mining?
* **Sociology:** How can we think about the relationship between future space-based and earth-based actors?
* **Engineering:** How might we be able to use the principles of freedom engineering or differential technological development to minimize bad outcomes in outer space?
* **Astrophysics:** What are the implications of space topology and resource distributions on space futures and development?

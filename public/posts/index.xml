      <description>The United States should encourage the commercial development of active orbital debris removal technology.
It is our duty as a global space industry leader to take the first steps to mitigate the dangerous buildup of orbital debris, which usually originates from defunct satellites and can both damage existing satellites and prevent launches. China is the only state to have publicly demonstrated the physical disposal of a dead satellite by another satellite, also known as active debris removal.</description>

      <description>In late 2021, a missile launched above the atmosphere released a device that raced toward its target at hypersonic speed, concluding a successful test of a hypersonic glide vehicle for China. The test temporarily brought the race to develop hypersonic capabilities into the headlines, but it has been well underway for years.  
Hypersonic weapons are among the most recent advanced technologies being developed by top militaries globally to maintain strategic advantage.</description>

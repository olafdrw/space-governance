      <description>We are excited to announce the Space Futures Initiative, which has a mission of conducting research, education, and outreach to improve the longterm future in outer space for humanity and its descendants.  
Improving space governance frameworks and promoting longtermist norms and values for positive space futures are currently highly neglected areas. Addressing these problems requires collaboration between the longtermist community, space policy community, space industry, scientific community, and beyond.</description>
